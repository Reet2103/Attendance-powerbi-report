Steps to View the Attendance Report

I've created an engaging and interactive Power BI report named "Attendance Report". Here’s how you can navigate and use the report:

Home Page Navigation:
Open the Power BI report.
On the first page (the home page), click on the "View Report" button. This will take you to the main dashboard on the second page.
Using the Filter Pane:

To apply filters, click on the "Filter" button located at the upper right-hand side of the screen. This action opens the filter pane.
In the filter pane, you’ll find slicers for City and Campus. Select the filters you want to apply.
After setting your filters, click the "Done" button to apply them and close the filter pane. If you need to reset all filters, simply click on the "Clear All Slicers" button.
To close the filter pane without applying any changes, click the "Close" button.

Exploring the Main Dashboard:

Slicers: Use the City and Campus slicers to dynamically filter the data.

Cards: Observe the key metrics displayed, such as Total Students and AVG Attendance.

Pie Chart: Visualize the "Attendance by Category" (Low, Medium, High).

Stacked Column Chart: View the distribution of "Students by City".

Stacked Bar Chart: See the number of "Students by Campus".

Table: Review detailed data, including Campus, Count of Students, AVG Attendance, and Attendance Category.

Returning to the Home Page:

To return to the home page, click on the button located at the upper left-hand side. This will take you back to the initial screen.
